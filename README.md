Created a platform for multiple games I created. Platform animations made with GSAP.


Created a website where I could host the multiple games that I created during a Javascript course in Hyper Island.
The website shows 4 different games who vary in complicity both in terms of the game and how the sites store their respective highscore lists.
The "Jumping Dinosaur" game stores your score in a local storage, where as the "Snake" and "Pop It" games store the highscores on Firebase.
